# Chicago-Crime-Data-Analysis

The analysis aims to predict whether the proportion of crimes that are Property, Persons, Society, or Serious, is above or below the median for a specified location (i.e. Census Tract). The prediction uses crime data from the City of Chicago and census data as possible covariates. 

Attempted models in the R code include logistic regression, logistic regression with LASSO, logistic regression with spatial dependence, logistic regression with spatio-temporal dependence, and random forest regression.
